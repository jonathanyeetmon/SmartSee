# SmartSee
## Logo detection implementation
SmartSee has implemented a state of the art logo detection machine learning algorithim. Using Tensorflow and Keras backend coupled with OpenCV and Yolo-v5 object detection, we were able to create a model that can detect logos from over 292 companies. In the LogoDet folder, you will be able to see our Convolosional Neural Network Approach to creating a logo detection computer vision model.

## Frontend
SmartSee will be available on both a web front and a app. As of now, we are working on the webfront. Click the assoicated folder to view implementation and deployment.
